# Kelp Bed Simulations
Using multiple LLMs along with the code from [Kelp Bed Drone](https://github.com/kelp-biochar/kelp-drone)
repository, this repository is the record of Kelp Bed Simulations as a
method generating the necessary features and tests for code and interactions
from three or more Kelp Bed Drones. These simulations track responses
from various scenarios to train and develop kelp drones for real-world 
deployments.
